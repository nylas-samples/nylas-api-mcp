## Test your auth settings

When you have your provider auth apps and connectors working, you can test them out by creating a grant for each type of auth flow. You can then use these grants to test your upgraded Nylas Email, Calendar, and Contacts API integrations.

As you test, you might find that you need to modify your v3 scopes. If you do, remember to change them on both your provider auth apps and in any defaults you set on the associated connectors (and connector credentials, if you're using them).
