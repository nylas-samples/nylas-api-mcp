## Threads webhook notifications

Nylas v3 doesn't include Threads webhook triggers. Instead, you receive Messages notifications for updates to threads.

You can subscribe to the `thread.replied` trigger if you [enable message tracking](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/v3/email/message-tracking/). This allows you to get notifications when a participant replies to an email message in a thread.
