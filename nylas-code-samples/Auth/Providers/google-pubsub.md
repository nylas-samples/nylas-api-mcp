### Set up Google Pub/Sub

If your project monitors for email message-related webhook notifications from Google services, you must [set up a Pub/Sub topic in your GCP app](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/dev-guide/provider-guides/google/connect-google-pub-sub/) so Google can notify you about changes to email messages in real-time. This is _required_.

For complete and detailed information, see [Create a Google authentication application for Nylas v3](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/dev-guide/provider-guides/google/create-google-app/).
